# 431W-final-project

## Setup
1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Clone the git repo. You may need to [set up an ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to your github account if you haven't already.
3. Nagivate to the source directory. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
4. Connect to `http://localhost:8000` using your favorite web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc).

_We may need to add steps about initializing the db later_
